basically old scripts I had and don't use but that someone else could find useful

## ripoffcai
### Files:
- ripoffcai.py

### Required dependancies:
- Ollama app
- At least one ollama model
- Ollama python module

### How to use:
Running ripoffcai.py for the first time will create a characters.json file. Add in your characters and their definitions using the following format:
`{"sample character (always a lowercase name)": {"Description": "Describe your character here. This is visible to the user.", "Definition": "How should the ai play as this character? Describe the character's appearance, personality, and optionally add in how the ai greets the user!"}`

Once you've added in characters, you can use the command `new` and create a new chat with your character!

Please note this script is very very broken, use at your own risk!
